# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Solutions in C++

Welcome to the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** repository! This repository contains a collection of OOP programs implemented in **C++**, demonstrating key concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more. The programs are designed to help you understand and apply core OOP principles.

## Prerequisites

To run the programs in this repository, make sure you have **MinGW** installed on your system. MinGW provides the necessary tools to compile and run C++ programs.

### Installation of MinGW

You can follow this [MinGW Installation Guide](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) to set up MinGW on your PC.

### Compile and Run the Code

To compile and run the C++ programs, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder containing the `.cpp` file.
2. Use the following command to compile the program:

   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o filename_without_extension.exe
   ```

3. After compilation, run the program with:

   ```bash
   ./filename_without_extension.exe
   ```

## OOP Program Structure

Each C++ program in this repository follows a consistent structure that demonstrates OOP principles. Key components youâ€™ll find include:

- **Classes and Objects**: Encapsulate data and functions that operate on the data.
- **Inheritance**: Reuse existing code by creating new classes derived from existing ones.
- **Polymorphism**: Achieved through function overloading, operator overloading, and virtual functions.
- **Constructors and Destructors**: For object initialization and clean-up.
- **Encapsulation**: Private and public access specifiers are used to protect data.
- **Abstraction**: Simplification of complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.

## Example Code Structure

Here is a typical template for C++ OOP programs in this repository:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Class definition
class ClassName {
    private:
        // Private data members

    public:
        // Constructor
        ClassName() {
            // Initialization code
        }

        // Member function
        void memberFunction() {
            // Function code
        }

        // Destructor
        ~ClassName() {
            // Clean-up code
        }
};

// Main function
int main() {
    ClassName obj;  // Object creation
    obj.memberFunction();  // Calling a member function

    return 0;
}
```
